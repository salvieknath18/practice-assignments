2. go to practice-assignment folder: `cd practice-assignment`.
3. Switch to assignment branch: `git switch hotel-room-booking`
4. cd to hotel-room-booking folder: `cd hotel-room-booking`


To run Problem 1 part 1:
To run booking logic: run command `python main.py`
To run unit tests: run command `python -m unittest tests/test_hotel.py`

To run Problem 1 part 2:
To run maximum infection time logic: run command `python infection_time.py`
To run unit tests: run command `python -m unittest tests/test_infection_time.py`

There are some best practice under To-Do:
1. Adding logging in the code
2. Adding Custom exception handling the code
3. Adding docstring in functions to generate module documentation
4. Adding some more unit tests to cover all scenario
